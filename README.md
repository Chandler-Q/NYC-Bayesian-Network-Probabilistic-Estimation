# NYC-Bayesian-Network-Probabilistic-Estimation
This code is the source code of “A Probabilistic Estimation of Traffic Flow between AOIs using the Bayesian Network in Smart Cities”.

This script has three parts:
  1. Data processing
  2. Identification of ST-DBSCAN AOIs
  3. Bayesian network construction and inference, based on hybrid method scores of the Dirichlet distribution
